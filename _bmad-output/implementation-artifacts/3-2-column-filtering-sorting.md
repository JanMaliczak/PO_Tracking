# Story 3.2: Column Filtering & Sorting

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a user,
I want to filter and sort the PO list by any displayed column,
so that I can quickly narrow down to the specific PO lines I need to work with.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the PO list view is displayed
   - When the user applies a filter on any displayed column per FR11
   - Then filter controls are available for: supplier, item, SKU, PO number, final customer, status, delay classification, source quality, ready quantity, date ranges, and any active custom columns
   - And text-based columns support partial match (contains) filtering
   - And date columns support range filtering (from/to)
   - And status and source quality columns support multi-select filtering
   - And numeric columns (quantities) support range filtering
2. Given a filter is applied
   - When the filter value is submitted
   - Then the table body is refreshed via HTMX partial swap (`_table_body.html`) without full page reload
   - And the partial update completes within 2 seconds for up to 5,000 PO lines per NFR2
   - And active filters are visually indicated so the user knows which filters are applied
   - And pagination resets to page 1 when filters change
3. Given multiple filters are applied
   - When filters are combined
   - Then all active filters are applied together (AND logic)
   - And the user can clear individual filters or all filters at once
4. Given the PO list is displayed
   - When the user clicks a column header to sort per FR12
   - Then the table re-sorts by that column via HTMX partial refresh
   - And clicking the same column header toggles between ascending and descending order
   - And the current sort column and direction are visually indicated with an arrow icon
   - And due date remains the default sort when no explicit sort is selected

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- This story belongs to Epic 3 and should align implementation to the PRD, architecture, and UX artifacts.
- Keep scope constrained to the acceptance criteria above; avoid introducing unrelated behavior changes.
- Prefer iterative delivery with HTMX partial updates and server-rendered templates where interaction requires dynamic updates.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement exactly the behaviors required by the acceptance criteria and preserve role-based data scoping.
- Use Django model/view/form/template patterns that match existing project structure.
- Ensure write operations that affect business state emit append-only audit events where applicable.
- Preserve performance expectations for list/detail views and partial updates as defined in NFRs.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture boundaries in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (views orchestrate, services handle business logic, managers/querysets enforce scoping).
- Keep HTMX responses in underscore-prefixed template fragments for partial swaps.
- Enforce RBAC at endpoint and queryset levels (`@role_required`, `.for_user(request.user)`).
- Maintain append-only principles for audit/event history updates.

### Library Framework Requirements

- Runtime stack alignment: Django 5.2.x, `mssql-django 1.6`, `django-htmx 1.27.0`, Bootstrap 5.3.x patterns, `openpyxl` for export flows.
- Do not introduce SPA frameworks or alternate backend patterns that conflict with the architecture document.

### File Structure Requirements

- Follow established app boundaries under `apps/` and template fragments under `templates/`.

### Testing Requirements

- Add unit/integration tests for acceptance criteria behavior and authorization boundaries.
- Add HTMX response tests for fragment endpoints where relevant.
- Verify regression safety for role scoping, validation rules, and business state transitions.

### Latest Tech Information

- Keep implementation compatible with current architecture-pinned stack versions in planning artifacts.
- If upgrading a dependency, validate compatibility with `mssql-django` and document rationale before applying.

### Project Context Reference

- Primary source story definition: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` (Epic 3, Story 3.2)
- Architecture guardrails: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
- UX requirements and interaction patterns: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`
- Requirement baseline: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming).
- Note and justify any detected variances before implementation.

- Cite all technical details with source paths and sections, e.g. [Source: docs/<file>.md#Section]

## Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [ ] [AI-Review][HIGH] Validate implementation against all acceptance criteria before marking story complete.
- [ ] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Add/confirm test coverage for role scoping, validation, and HTMX response paths.
- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Keep documentation sections synchronized with any implementation changes.

## Change Log

- 2026-02-13: Regenerated Story 3.2 using the full implementation template format aligned to Story 1.1 structure.
