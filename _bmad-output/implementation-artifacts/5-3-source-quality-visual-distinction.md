# Story 5.3: Source Quality Visual Distinction

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a user,
I want to immediately see whether a PO line's latest update is supplier-confirmed, an expeditor estimate, or has no supplier response,
so that I can assess data reliability at a glance across all views.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a PO line has a source quality classification from its most recent milestone update
   - When the PO list view renders per FR25
   - Then the Source Quality Badge displays with consistent styling across all rows:
   - And "Supplier confirmed" renders as a green badge with checkmark icon and text label
   - And "Expeditor estimate" renders as a yellow/amber badge with estimate icon and text label
   - And "No supplier response" renders as a red badge with warning icon and text label
2. Given the PO detail panel is open
   - When source quality is displayed in the header and timeline per FR25
   - Then the same Source Quality Badge component is used consistently
   - And each timeline entry shows the source quality of that specific update
3. Given source quality badges are rendered
   - When accessibility is verified
   - Then every badge conveys its meaning through color plus icon plus text per NFR25
   - And badges have appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers per NFR24
   - And the three states are distinguishable in grayscale/high-contrast modes
4. Given a PO line has no milestone updates yet
   - When the source quality column is rendered
   - Then the cell displays em dash indicating no source quality data available

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- This story belongs to Epic 5 and should align implementation to the PRD, architecture, and UX artifacts.
- Keep scope constrained to the acceptance criteria above; avoid introducing unrelated behavior changes.
- Prefer iterative delivery with HTMX partial updates and server-rendered templates where interaction requires dynamic updates.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement exactly the behaviors required by the acceptance criteria and preserve role-based data scoping.
- Use Django model/view/form/template patterns that match existing project structure.
- Ensure write operations that affect business state emit append-only audit events where applicable.
- Preserve performance expectations for list/detail views and partial updates as defined in NFRs.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture boundaries in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (views orchestrate, services handle business logic, managers/querysets enforce scoping).
- Keep HTMX responses in underscore-prefixed template fragments for partial swaps.
- Enforce RBAC at endpoint and queryset levels (`@role_required`, `.for_user(request.user)`).
- Maintain append-only principles for audit/event history updates.

### Library Framework Requirements

- Runtime stack alignment: Django 5.2.x, `mssql-django 1.6`, `django-htmx 1.27.0`, Bootstrap 5.3.x patterns, `openpyxl` for export flows.
- Do not introduce SPA frameworks or alternate backend patterns that conflict with the architecture document.

### File Structure Requirements

- Follow established app boundaries under `apps/` and template fragments under `templates/`.

### Testing Requirements

- Add unit/integration tests for acceptance criteria behavior and authorization boundaries.
- Add HTMX response tests for fragment endpoints where relevant.
- Verify regression safety for role scoping, validation rules, and business state transitions.

### Latest Tech Information

- Keep implementation compatible with current architecture-pinned stack versions in planning artifacts.
- If upgrading a dependency, validate compatibility with `mssql-django` and document rationale before applying.

### Project Context Reference

- Primary source story definition: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` (Epic 5, Story 5.3)
- Architecture guardrails: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
- UX requirements and interaction patterns: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`
- Requirement baseline: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming).
- Note and justify any detected variances before implementation.

### References

- Cite all technical details with source paths and sections, e.g. [Source: docs/<file>.md#Section]

## Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [ ] [AI-Review][HIGH] Validate implementation against all acceptance criteria before marking story complete.
- [ ] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Add/confirm test coverage for role scoping, validation, and HTMX response paths.
- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Keep documentation sections synchronized with any implementation changes.

## Change Log

- 2026-02-13: Regenerated Story 5.3 using the full implementation template format aligned to Story 1.1 structure.
