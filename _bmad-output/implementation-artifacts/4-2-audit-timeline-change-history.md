# Story 4.2: Audit Timeline & Change History

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a user,
I want to see the full chronological timeline of all changes for a PO line,
so that I can understand who changed what, when, from what source, and why.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the PO detail panel is open and the timeline section loads
   - When the HTMX request to `/po/<int:pk>/timeline/` returns the `po/_timeline.html` fragment per FR18
   - Then a chronological timeline displays all audit events for that PO line
   - And events are sorted in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
2. Given the timeline is rendered
   - When each event is displayed
   - Then it shows: the date and time of the change, the user who made it (or "System" for ingestion), the source classification (manual, bulk, inline, ingestion), the fields that changed with previous and new values, and the reason provided (if any)
   - And the timeline follows the UX spec's Audit Timeline component design
3. Given the timeline contains date change events
   - When a milestone date was updated
   - Then the event clearly shows the previous date, new date, source quality (confirmed/estimate/no response), and the reason text
4. Given the timeline contains ingestion change events
   - When an ERP snapshot detected field changes
   - Then the event shows source as "ingestion", the ERP fields that changed, and the previous/new values
   - And ingestion events are visually distinguishable from manual user events
5. Given the timeline has many events
   - When the list is long
   - Then the timeline section supports scrolling within the panel
   - And an initial batch of events is loaded with a "Load more" action for older events if needed
6. Given the timeline is rendered
   - When accessibility is verified
   - Then timeline entries use semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility per NFR24
   - And timestamps and field changes are conveyed through text (not color alone) per NFR25

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- This story belongs to Epic 4 and should align implementation to the PRD, architecture, and UX artifacts.
- Keep scope constrained to the acceptance criteria above; avoid introducing unrelated behavior changes.
- Prefer iterative delivery with HTMX partial updates and server-rendered templates where interaction requires dynamic updates.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement exactly the behaviors required by the acceptance criteria and preserve role-based data scoping.
- Use Django model/view/form/template patterns that match existing project structure.
- Ensure write operations that affect business state emit append-only audit events where applicable.
- Preserve performance expectations for list/detail views and partial updates as defined in NFRs.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture boundaries in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (views orchestrate, services handle business logic, managers/querysets enforce scoping).
- Keep HTMX responses in underscore-prefixed template fragments for partial swaps.
- Enforce RBAC at endpoint and queryset levels (`@role_required`, `.for_user(request.user)`).
- Maintain append-only principles for audit/event history updates.

### Library Framework Requirements

- Runtime stack alignment: Django 5.2.x, `mssql-django 1.6`, `django-htmx 1.27.0`, Bootstrap 5.3.x patterns, `openpyxl` for export flows.
- Do not introduce SPA frameworks or alternate backend patterns that conflict with the architecture document.

### File Structure Requirements

- Follow established app boundaries under `apps/` and template fragments under `templates/`.
- Story references path: `po/_timeline.html`

### Testing Requirements

- Add unit/integration tests for acceptance criteria behavior and authorization boundaries.
- Add HTMX response tests for fragment endpoints where relevant.
- Verify regression safety for role scoping, validation rules, and business state transitions.

### Latest Tech Information

- Keep implementation compatible with current architecture-pinned stack versions in planning artifacts.
- If upgrading a dependency, validate compatibility with `mssql-django` and document rationale before applying.

### Project Context Reference

- Primary source story definition: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` (Epic 4, Story 4.2)
- Architecture guardrails: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
- UX requirements and interaction patterns: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`
- Requirement baseline: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming).
- Note and justify any detected variances before implementation.

## Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [ ] [AI-Review][HIGH] Validate implementation against all acceptance criteria before marking story complete.
- [ ] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Add/confirm test coverage for role scoping, validation, and HTMX response paths.
- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Keep documentation sections synchronized with any implementation changes.

## Change Log

- 2026-02-13: Regenerated Story 4.2 using the full implementation template format aligned to Story 1.1 structure.
