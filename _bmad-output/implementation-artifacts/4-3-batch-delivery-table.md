# Story 4.3: Batch Delivery Table

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a user,
I want to see the batch delivery table for a PO line showing both historical and planned batches,
so that I can understand the delivery breakdown and what has been shipped versus what is planned.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the PO detail panel is open and the batch section loads
   - When the HTMX request to `/po/<int:pk>/batches/` returns the `po/_batch_list.html` fragment per FR19
   - Then a table displays all batches associated with that PO line
2. Given the batch table is rendered
   - When historical batches exist (reconstructed from ERP data in Epic 2)
   - Then each historical batch row shows: batch identifier, delivered quantity, delivery date (InDate), and source ("ERP")
   - And historical batches are visually distinguished from planned batches
3. Given the batch table is rendered
   - When planned future batches exist (created by expeditors in Epic 6)
   - Then each planned batch row shows: batch identifier, allocated quantity, expected dispatch date, batch status, and source ("Manual")
   - And planned batches display their current lifecycle status (Planned, Confirmed, Dispatched, Delivered)
4. Given the batch table contains both historical and planned batches
   - When the table is sorted
   - Then batches are ordered chronologically by delivery/dispatch date
   - And the table clearly separates or labels historical vs planned sections
5. Given no batches exist for a PO line
   - When the batch section renders
   - Then a message indicates no batch records are available for this PO line
   - And the empty state uses the em dash (`—`) display convention

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- This story belongs to Epic 4 and should align implementation to the PRD, architecture, and UX artifacts.
- Keep scope constrained to the acceptance criteria above; avoid introducing unrelated behavior changes.
- Prefer iterative delivery with HTMX partial updates and server-rendered templates where interaction requires dynamic updates.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement exactly the behaviors required by the acceptance criteria and preserve role-based data scoping.
- Use Django model/view/form/template patterns that match existing project structure.
- Ensure write operations that affect business state emit append-only audit events where applicable.
- Preserve performance expectations for list/detail views and partial updates as defined in NFRs.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture boundaries in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (views orchestrate, services handle business logic, managers/querysets enforce scoping).
- Keep HTMX responses in underscore-prefixed template fragments for partial swaps.
- Enforce RBAC at endpoint and queryset levels (`@role_required`, `.for_user(request.user)`).
- Maintain append-only principles for audit/event history updates.

### Library Framework Requirements

- Runtime stack alignment: Django 5.2.x, `mssql-django 1.6`, `django-htmx 1.27.0`, Bootstrap 5.3.x patterns, `openpyxl` for export flows.
- Do not introduce SPA frameworks or alternate backend patterns that conflict with the architecture document.

### File Structure Requirements

- Follow established app boundaries under `apps/` and template fragments under `templates/`.
- Story references path: `po/_batch_list.html`

### Testing Requirements

- Add unit/integration tests for acceptance criteria behavior and authorization boundaries.
- Add HTMX response tests for fragment endpoints where relevant.
- Verify regression safety for role scoping, validation rules, and business state transitions.

### Latest Tech Information

- Keep implementation compatible with current architecture-pinned stack versions in planning artifacts.
- If upgrading a dependency, validate compatibility with `mssql-django` and document rationale before applying.

### Project Context Reference

- Primary source story definition: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` (Epic 4, Story 4.3)
- Architecture guardrails: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
- UX requirements and interaction patterns: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`
- Requirement baseline: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming).
- Note and justify any detected variances before implementation.

- Cite all technical details with source paths and sections, e.g. [Source: docs/<file>.md#Section]

## Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [ ] [AI-Review][HIGH] Validate implementation against all acceptance criteria before marking story complete.
- [ ] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Add/confirm test coverage for role scoping, validation, and HTMX response paths.
- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Keep documentation sections synchronized with any implementation changes.

## Change Log

- 2026-02-13: Regenerated Story 4.3 using the full implementation template format aligned to Story 1.1 structure.
