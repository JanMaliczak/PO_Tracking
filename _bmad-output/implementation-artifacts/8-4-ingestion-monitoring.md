# Story 8.4: Ingestion Monitoring

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a admin,
I want to view ingestion job history with run details and error information,
so that I can verify data is flowing correctly and diagnose failures quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given an admin navigates to the Ingestion Monitor at `/admin-portal/ingestion/`
   - When the page renders (`admin_portal/ingestion_monitor.html`) per FR44
   - Then a list of ingestion job runs is displayed in reverse chronological order
   - And each run shows: run timestamp, status (success/partial/failed), duration, PO lines processed, new lines created, change events detected, batches reconstructed, xref gaps found, and error count
2. Given the ingestion history is displayed
   - When the admin clicks on a specific run
   - Then the run detail expands or loads showing: full error messages, list of unmapped item codes, list of PO lines with changes, and any retry attempts
   - And error details include sufficient context for diagnosis
3. Given the most recent ingestion run failed
   - When the monitor page renders
   - Then the latest run is highlighted with an error indicator
   - And the failure reason is visible without clicking into details
   - And the admin dashboard health indicator also reflects the failure state
4. Given ingestion runs are displayed
   - When the admin filters the history
   - Then filters are available for: date range, status (success/failed/partial), and the list refreshes via HTMX
5. Given ingestion failures and successes are logged per NFR29
   - When an ingestion event is recorded
   - Then the audit event is written within 60 seconds of detection
   - And the event includes timestamp, severity, and event type

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- This story belongs to Epic 8 and should align implementation to the PRD, architecture, and UX artifacts.
- Keep scope constrained to the acceptance criteria above; avoid introducing unrelated behavior changes.
- Prefer iterative delivery with HTMX partial updates and server-rendered templates where interaction requires dynamic updates.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement exactly the behaviors required by the acceptance criteria and preserve role-based data scoping.
- Use Django model/view/form/template patterns that match existing project structure.
- Ensure write operations that affect business state emit append-only audit events where applicable.
- Preserve performance expectations for list/detail views and partial updates as defined in NFRs.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture boundaries in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (views orchestrate, services handle business logic, managers/querysets enforce scoping).
- Keep HTMX responses in underscore-prefixed template fragments for partial swaps.
- Enforce RBAC at endpoint and queryset levels (`@role_required`, `.for_user(request.user)`).
- Maintain append-only principles for audit/event history updates.

### Library Framework Requirements

- Runtime stack alignment: Django 5.2.x, `mssql-django 1.6`, `django-htmx 1.27.0`, Bootstrap 5.3.x patterns, `openpyxl` for export flows.
- Do not introduce SPA frameworks or alternate backend patterns that conflict with the architecture document.

### File Structure Requirements

- Follow established app boundaries under `apps/` and template fragments under `templates/`.
- Story references path: `admin_portal/ingestion_monitor.html`

### Testing Requirements

- Add unit/integration tests for acceptance criteria behavior and authorization boundaries.
- Add HTMX response tests for fragment endpoints where relevant.
- Verify regression safety for role scoping, validation rules, and business state transitions.

### Latest Tech Information

- Keep implementation compatible with current architecture-pinned stack versions in planning artifacts.
- If upgrading a dependency, validate compatibility with `mssql-django` and document rationale before applying.

### Project Context Reference

- Primary source story definition: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` (Epic 8, Story 8.4)
- Architecture guardrails: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
- UX requirements and interaction patterns: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`
- Requirement baseline: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming).
- Note and justify any detected variances before implementation.

### References

- Cite all technical details with source paths and sections, e.g. [Source: docs/<file>.md#Section]

## Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [ ] [AI-Review][HIGH] Validate implementation against all acceptance criteria before marking story complete.
- [ ] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Add/confirm test coverage for role scoping, validation, and HTMX response paths.
- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Keep documentation sections synchronized with any implementation changes.

## Change Log

- 2026-02-13: Regenerated Story 8.4 using the full implementation template format aligned to Story 1.1 structure.
