# Story 3.5: Column Chooser & Preference Persistence

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a user,
I want to show or hide columns in the PO list and have my preferences remembered,
so that I see only the information relevant to my workflow without reconfiguring each session.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the PO list view is displayed
   - When the user opens the Column Chooser Control per FR17a
   - Then a panel or dropdown displays all available columns with checkboxes for visibility
   - And the control follows the UX spec's Column Chooser Control component design
   - And the user can check or uncheck individual columns to show or hide them
2. Given the user changes column visibility
   - When the selection is applied
   - Then the table header and table body refresh via HTMX to reflect the new column set
   - And both `_table_header.html` and `_table_body.html` fragments are swapped
3. Given a user has customized their column visibility
   - When they log out and log back in per FR17b
   - Then their column visibility preferences are persisted and restored from the database
   - And the `static/js/column-chooser.js` script handles the client-side interaction
   - And preferences are stored per-user in the app database (not browser local storage)
4. Given a new user logs in for the first time
   - When no saved preferences exist per FR17c
   - Then role-based default column visibility is applied
   - And expeditor defaults differ from planner defaults (expeditors see supplier-action-oriented columns, planners see exception-oriented columns)
   - And users can override these defaults at any time via the column chooser
5. Given column preferences are persisted
   - When the user model or a related preference model stores visibility
   - Then a `UserColumnPreference` model or JSON field stores the ordered list of visible column identifiers per user
   - And the preference is loaded on each PO list page render

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- This story belongs to Epic 3 and should align implementation to the PRD, architecture, and UX artifacts.
- Keep scope constrained to the acceptance criteria above; avoid introducing unrelated behavior changes.
- Prefer iterative delivery with HTMX partial updates and server-rendered templates where interaction requires dynamic updates.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement exactly the behaviors required by the acceptance criteria and preserve role-based data scoping.
- Use Django model/view/form/template patterns that match existing project structure.
- Ensure write operations that affect business state emit append-only audit events where applicable.
- Preserve performance expectations for list/detail views and partial updates as defined in NFRs.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture boundaries in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (views orchestrate, services handle business logic, managers/querysets enforce scoping).
- Keep HTMX responses in underscore-prefixed template fragments for partial swaps.
- Enforce RBAC at endpoint and queryset levels (`@role_required`, `.for_user(request.user)`).
- Maintain append-only principles for audit/event history updates.

### Library Framework Requirements

- Runtime stack alignment: Django 5.2.x, `mssql-django 1.6`, `django-htmx 1.27.0`, Bootstrap 5.3.x patterns, `openpyxl` for export flows.
- Do not introduce SPA frameworks or alternate backend patterns that conflict with the architecture document.

### File Structure Requirements

- Follow established app boundaries under `apps/` and template fragments under `templates/`.
- Story references path: `static/js/column-chooser.js`

### Testing Requirements

- Add unit/integration tests for acceptance criteria behavior and authorization boundaries.
- Add HTMX response tests for fragment endpoints where relevant.
- Verify regression safety for role scoping, validation rules, and business state transitions.

### Latest Tech Information

- Keep implementation compatible with current architecture-pinned stack versions in planning artifacts.
- If upgrading a dependency, validate compatibility with `mssql-django` and document rationale before applying.

### Project Context Reference

- Primary source story definition: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` (Epic 3, Story 3.5)
- Architecture guardrails: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
- UX requirements and interaction patterns: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming).
- Note and justify any detected variances before implementation.

## Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [ ] [AI-Review][HIGH] Validate implementation against all acceptance criteria before marking story complete.
- [ ] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Add/confirm test coverage for role scoping, validation, and HTMX response paths.
- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Keep documentation sections synchronized with any implementation changes.

## Change Log

- 2026-02-13: Regenerated Story 3.5 using the full implementation template format aligned to Story 1.1 structure.
