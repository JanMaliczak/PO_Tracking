# Story 5.2: Ready Quantity Recording

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a expeditor,
I want to record ready quantities as suppliers complete production in increments,
so that planners can see how much product is available for dispatch at any point.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the milestone update modal is open for a PO line
   - When the ready quantity fields are displayed per FR22a
   - Then the form includes: ready quantity (numeric input) and readiness date (date picker)
   - And these fields are available alongside the milestone date update or independently
2. Given the expeditor enters a ready quantity and readiness date
   - When the form is submitted
   - Then a ready quantity record is created for that PO line with the specified quantity and date
   - And an audit event is created with `event_type='ready_qty_recorded'`, the quantity, date, and user
3. Given a PO line has had previous ready quantity entries per FR22b
   - When a new ready quantity is recorded
   - Then the new entry is added as an incremental record (not replacing previous entries)
   - And the system tracks multiple ready-quantity entries representing partial production completions
4. Given a PO line has multiple ready quantity entries per FR22c
   - When the PO list or detail panel renders quantity information
   - Then the cumulative ready quantity is displayed alongside ordered quantity and remaining quantity
   - And the display distinguishes between: goods produced (cumulative ready qty), goods dispatched, and goods outstanding (remaining)
   - And the Quantity Progress Display component reflects the cumulative ready quantity
5. Given the expeditor enters a ready quantity that would exceed the ordered quantity
   - When the form is submitted
   - Then a validation warning is displayed (the total ready quantity including this entry would exceed ordered quantity)
   - And the expeditor can confirm to proceed or correct the value

## Dev Notes

### Developer Context Section

- This story belongs to Epic 5 and should align implementation to the PRD, architecture, and UX artifacts.
- Keep scope constrained to the acceptance criteria above; avoid introducing unrelated behavior changes.
- Prefer iterative delivery with HTMX partial updates and server-rendered templates where interaction requires dynamic updates.

### Technical Requirements

- Implement exactly the behaviors required by the acceptance criteria and preserve role-based data scoping.
- Use Django model/view/form/template patterns that match existing project structure.
- Ensure write operations that affect business state emit append-only audit events where applicable.
- Preserve performance expectations for list/detail views and partial updates as defined in NFRs.

### Architecture Compliance

- Follow architecture boundaries in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` (views orchestrate, services handle business logic, managers/querysets enforce scoping).
- Keep HTMX responses in underscore-prefixed template fragments for partial swaps.
- Enforce RBAC at endpoint and queryset levels (`@role_required`, `.for_user(request.user)`).
- Maintain append-only principles for audit/event history updates.

### Library Framework Requirements

- Runtime stack alignment: Django 5.2.x, `mssql-django 1.6`, `django-htmx 1.27.0`, Bootstrap 5.3.x patterns, `openpyxl` for export flows.
- Do not introduce SPA frameworks or alternate backend patterns that conflict with the architecture document.

### File Structure Requirements

- Follow established app boundaries under `apps/` and template fragments under `templates/`.

### Testing Requirements

- Add unit/integration tests for acceptance criteria behavior and authorization boundaries.
- Add HTMX response tests for fragment endpoints where relevant.
- Verify regression safety for role scoping, validation rules, and business state transitions.

### Latest Tech Information

- Keep implementation compatible with current architecture-pinned stack versions in planning artifacts.
- If upgrading a dependency, validate compatibility with `mssql-django` and document rationale before applying.

### Project Context Reference

- Primary source story definition: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` (Epic 5, Story 5.2)
- Architecture guardrails: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
- UX requirements and interaction patterns: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md`
- Requirement baseline: `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming).
- Note and justify any detected variances before implementation.

### References

- Cite all technical details with source paths and sections, e.g. [Source: docs/<file>.md#Section]

## Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [ ] [AI-Review][HIGH] Validate implementation against all acceptance criteria before marking story complete.
- [ ] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Add/confirm test coverage for role scoping, validation, and HTMX response paths.
- [ ] [AI-Review][LOW] Keep documentation sections synchronized with any implementation changes.

## Change Log

- 2026-02-13: Regenerated Story 5.2 using the full implementation template format aligned to Story 1.1 structure.
